# letsBuild

**letsBuild** is a modern full-stack platform for sharing and managing creative ideas. It enables users to register, post ideas written in Markdown, vote, comment, and engage with the community. Ideas are ranked by engagement votes, views, and comments which also determine which ideas appear in the **Featured** section.

The platform is designed to help individuals and teams turn sparks of inspiration into discoverable, ranked, and discussed contributions. Built with a carefully selected tech stack, letsBuild emphasizes responsiveness, developer-friendly patterns, and clean design.
